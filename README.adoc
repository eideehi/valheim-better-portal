Better Portal is a mod that allows you to change the destination of portals to any tag. I know that there are already mods with the same functionality, but I created this mod because I did not want to install Jotunn. If you already have Jotunn installed, there is no advantage to using this mod. This mod has only minimal functionality.

IMPORTANT: This mod has been developed by an individual and is not associated with the game's developer in any way. Please refrain from asking the developer any questions regarding this mod.

== Features
When interacting with the portal, you can set the destination tag by pressing the Shift key at the same time. Portals do not have to be connected to each other and can teleport one way.

TIP: Pressing the Insert Key while entering the destination tag will execute autocomplete. Also, pressing the up or down arrow key will rotate existing tags.

NOTE: If multiple portals with the specified destination tag exist, they will be randomly connected.
